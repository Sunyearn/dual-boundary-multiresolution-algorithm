# dual-boundary-multiresolution-algorithm

A dual-boundary multiresolution algorithm is proposed to improve the efficiency of divergence correction in magnetotelluric forward modelling. This new multiresolution algorithm activates the boundary of the coarse grid and that of the fine grid; it eliminates only the nodes of the fine grid in the binding area. The divergence correction is equivalently replaced by the Dirichlet boundary problem of the Laplace equation. To verify the accuracy of this new multiresolution algorithm, I compare the results of my algorithm with that of the other two multiresolution algorithms contained in this repository,
